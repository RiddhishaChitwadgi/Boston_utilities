# Boston Utilities Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Boston Utilities project. The project aims to analyze and model utility data for the city of Boston using various data science and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on the [City of Boston Utility Data](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/city-of-boston-utility-data) website. Download the dataset and place it in the project directory before running the notebooks.

## Project Structure

- **01-Data-Cleaning.ipynb**: Initial commit for data cleaning. This notebook includes the code for cleaning and preprocessing the raw utility data.

- **02-EDA.ipynb**: Initial commit for exploratory data analysis (EDA). This notebook explores the dataset, visualizes key insights, and identifies patterns.

- **03-linear-regression-model.ipynb**: Initial commit for linear regression modeling. This notebook contains code for building and evaluating a linear regression model based on the preprocessed data.

- **04-gradientboost-model.ipynb**: Initial commit for gradient boost modeling. This notebook includes the implementation of a gradient boosting model for predicting utility-related metrics.

- **05-spark-session.ipynb**: Initial commit for Spark session. This notebook demonstrates the usage of Apache Spark for scalable data processing and analysis.
